过程说明：
  1：打开open数据库 base_config 确定要导出数据对应的 app_key
  1：在open数据库创建BACKUP存储过程
  3：执行BACKUP存储过程 ，输入app_key  ，整理数据到临时库micro_system_temp；
     可以查看BACKUP执行结果，验证数据是否均正常备份
  4：导出micro_system_temp 表和表结构sql
  5：在目标库 setting中执行步骤4中的sql文件
  6：将system_config_temp，比对system_config 进行插入

 备注：
     micro_system_temp 中数据结构说明
       除 system_config_temp 被重命名外，其余表和open中表同名
       去除app_key字段
       另外删除不需要的img等表
       最后micro_system_temp中表明细如下：
       base_config
       business_config
       company_info
       express_company
       online_service
       online_service_item
       store_express_company_rela
       store_resource
       store_resource_cate
       sys_sms
       system_config_temp
       system_resource
       system_resource_cate
       wechat_login_set
       wechat_share_set
